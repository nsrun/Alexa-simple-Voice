# Alexa-simple-Voice

A simple Python project to create an Alexa-like voice assistant. This project demonstrates how to use speech recognition and text-to-speech to build a basic voice interaction system.

## Features

- Voice command recognition
- Text-to-speech responses
- Easy to extend with custom commands

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `SpeechRecognition` library
- `pyttsx3` library
- Microphone and speakers

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Alexa-simple-Voice.git
cd Alexa-simple-Voice
```

2. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3
```

*Note:* For `SpeechRecognition`, you might also need to install additional dependencies depending on your OS.

## Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Speak your command when prompted. The system will recognize your voice and respond accordingly.

## Customization

- Edit the `alexa.py` file to add new commands and responses.
- Integrate APIs for more advanced features.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your microphone is properly connected and configured.
- If recognition is poor, try adjusting microphone settings or noise environment.
